line_processor project created by Sunil Jain for Operating Systems 1 at OSU.
Description: This is a program called line_processor, that uses threads to read in input, separate the input,
 *           processes the input, and outputs the input without having to wait for all the input to be inserted
 *           before doing anything.

To compile: use "make"
